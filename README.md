# RESTAPI_JAX-RS
Reference: Developing RESTful APIs with JAX-RS course from Java Brains channel

In this project I am learning how to implement REST API using JAX-RS in Java Programming Language
I am implementing all the CRUD operations of the API

I have taken messenger app functinality and implementing the reading the messages functinality, updating the messsages, deleting the 
messages and creating the messages of a particular user profile.

Here, a dummy databse has been created with static values just to visualize the functionality. In reality we can connect out API to
an actual databse and read dynamic data from it.
